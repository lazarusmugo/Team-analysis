Step 1
Start
Welcome message
print "Welcome to the FIFA WWC Analysis Program"

Step 2
Get user input for the CSV file
Repeat until a valid file is entered:
    print "Please enter the file name (without extension .csv): "
    Read user input as 'fileName'
    Set 'filePath' to 'fileName' + ".csv"
    if 'filePath' does not exist:
        print "File not found. Please enter a valid file name."

Step 3
Inform that the file is found
print "File found."

Step 4
Read data from the CSV file and store it in an array
Initialize an empty list 'dataList'
Try:
    Open 'filePath' as 'br' for reading
    Read the first line of 'br' as 'headerLine'
    if 'headerLine' is empty:
        print "The CSV file is empty. Please check the file."
        Return an empty array

    Repeat until there are no more lines in 'br':
        Read a line from 'br' as 'line'
        Split 'line' by ',' into 'data'
        if the length of 'data' is not 5:
            print "Invalid formatting in line: " + 'line'
            Continue to the next iteration

        Extract values from 'data'
        Create a 'TeamData' object from extracted values
        Add the 'TeamData' object to 'dataList'

    Close 'br'
Catch IOException:
    print the error message

Step 5
Convert 'dataList' to an array of 'TeamData'
Set 'dataArray' to 'dataList' as an array

Step 6
display options for data analysis
Repeat until the user chooses to exit:
    print "Data Analysis System:"
    print "1. Overall Analysis"
    print "2. Group Analysis"
    print "3. Exit"
    Read user input as 'analysisType'

    if 'analysisType' is "1":
        Perform overall analysis on 'dataArray'
    Else, if 'analysisType' is "2":
        Perform group analysis on 'dataArray'
    Else, if 'analysisType' is "3":
        print "Exiting the program. Goodbye!"
        Exit the loop
    Else:
        print "Invalid input. Please choose the correct option."

Step 7
End
